## Multimodal AI Agent for Investment Risk Assessment

This repository presents an enterprise-grade, multimodal AI system for automated investment risk assessment, built using Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and agent-based orchestration. The solution is designed to analyze and synthesize structured financial metrics, unstructured textual data, and external market signals to deliver reliable and explainable risk insights.

The architecture employs specialized AI agents responsible for data ingestion, contextual retrieval, analytical reasoning, risk scoring, and executive-level summarization. By integrating RAG, the system grounds LLM outputs in relevant financial documents, reports, and market information, reducing hallucinations and improving decision accuracy. Agentic workflows enable modularity, scalability, and clear separation of responsibilities, making the solution suitable for enterprise financial environments.

The project emphasizes interpretability and real-world applicability by generating transparent risk evaluations supported by quantitative indicators and qualitative reasoning. It is extensible by design and can be adapted for various BFSI use cases, including investment analysis, portfolio risk monitoring, and financial research automation.
